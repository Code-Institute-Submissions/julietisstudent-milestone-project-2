# Holiday Destinations - By Juliet Gardener
 
 **Second Milestone Project: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute**
 
 This is a frontend-only website I have designed for users to be able to search for their next holiday destination, with the search ability
 enabling them to find tourist attractions, accommodation, bars and restaurants.
 
## Demo
 
 A live demo can be found [here](https://julietisstudent.github.io/milestone-project-2/)
 
## UX
 
 My goal was to design a site that deployed Google Maps API to allow users to search for their next holiday destination, providing an 
 interactive data driven site.
 My goal was to provide search results for users that enabled them to complete all given easy functioning search reasons,
 entailing specific map integrations to carry out this.
 
## Technologies
